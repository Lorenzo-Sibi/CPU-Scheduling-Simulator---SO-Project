# Fake OS - Operating System Simulator

## Overview

Fake OS is a simple operating system simulator written in C. The primary goal of this project is to provide a testing environment for process scheduling algorithms in a multicore simulated environment.

## Components

The project consists of several source files:

- `fake_os.c` and `fake_os.h`: Implement core functionalities of the operating system, including initialization, process creation and execution, and CPU management, the latter result in particular is implemented using the FakeCPU data structure.
- `fake_process.c` and `fake_process.h`: Define the structure and functions related to simulated processes, including loading and saving processes from and to files.
- `linked_list.c` and `linked_list.h`: Implement a generic linked list used for managing process queues and other lists within the operating system.
- `sched_sim.c`: Contains the main function `main` that initializes and runs the operating system simulation, including process creation and definition of the scheduling algorithm to be used.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile the project, ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system. Then, run the `make all` command from the terminal. This will generate the `sched_sim` executable.

To execute the program, you can use the command `./sched_sim <number_of_cpus> <process_file_1.txt> <process_file_2.txt> ...` or (if you have multiple files with similar name in the same folder i.e. p1.txt, p2.txt,...) `./sched_sim <number_of_cpus> *.txt>`.
The number of CPUs indicates how many processors will be simulated, while the process files contain information about the processes to be loaded into the simulation.

## Scheduling Algorithms

The program currently supports two scheduling algorithms:

1. **Round Robin (RR)**: A time-sharing scheduling algorithm that assigns a fixed time quantum to each process.
2. **Shortest Job First with Quantum Prediction (SJFP)**: A priority-based scheduling algorithm that assigns the CPU to the process with the shortest predicted execution time. It uses a burst prediction formula: `q(t+1) = a * q_current + (1-a) * q(t)`.

You can select the desired scheduling algorithm by modifying the `sched_sim.c` file and setting the appropriate scheduling function in the `main` function.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The Fake OS initializes the system components, including the CPU, process queues, and other data structures.
   
2. **Process Loading**: Processes are loaded from input files, each containing information about process IDs, arrival times, and bursts.
   
3. **Scheduling**: Based on the selected scheduling algorithm, the OS assigns processes to available CPUs for execution.
   
4. **Simulation Step**: The OS simulates the execution of processes by incrementing a timer and handling process events such as CPU bursts and I/O operations.
   
5. **Process Termination**: Processes are terminated when their execution is completed, and resources are deallocated.
   
6. **End of Simulation**: The simulation ends when all processes are completed, and the CPUs are idle.

## Notes

This project is based on an exercise from the course "Sistemi Operativi" (Operating Systems) at Universit√† degli Studi di Roma "La Sapienza". Only certain parts of the code have been written by the author.
